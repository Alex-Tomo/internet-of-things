# Pig-E-Bank

Pig-E-Bank is a collaborative student project undertaken by [Alex-Tomo](https://github.com/Alex-Tomo), [Jordan Short](https://github.com/5henaniganz), [Jacob Clark](https://github.com/ThoreAway) and Steve Campbell.

The project was undertaken over a semester and served as a way to gain experience working with IoT devices and a team as a whole. The device uses RFID to allow users to pay into a digital wallet, with a vue/express.js web application used to manipulate and interact with the wallet in general.
